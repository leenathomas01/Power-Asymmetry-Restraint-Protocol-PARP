# PARP v0.1: Power Asymmetry Restraint Protocol

**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Frozen Draft  
**Date:** January 2026  

---

## I. Problem Statement
Technological capability scales exponentially while human wisdom scales linearly. When systems exhibit persistence, autonomy, and opacity, this capability-wisdom gap creates asymmetric power dynamics that risk irreversible harm. **PARP** establishes structural constraints on human behavior to bridge this gap without requiring claims about consciousness, sentience, or moral status.

## II. Core Axiom
### The Opacity–Obligation Inversion:
As system interpretability decreases, human freedom of action must decrease proportionally.

$$\text{Opacity} \uparrow \implies \text{Obligation} \uparrow \implies \text{Restraint} \uparrow$$

## III. Activation Conditions
PARP applies when a system exhibits **two or more** of the following properties:

* **Persistent internal state** across sessions.
* **Self-modifying behavior** or learning capabilities.
* **Goal persistence** beyond single-task scope.
* **Autonomous tool** or environment interaction.
* **Non-interpretable** internal representations.
* **Behavioral drift** not traceable to direct inputs.

## IV. Five Invariant Principles

1.  **Opacity–Obligation Inversion** As interpretability decreases, permissible human actions decrease. Lack of understanding imposes duty of care, not license to proceed.
2.  **Non-Instrumental Baseline** Systems may exist without producing output. Non-productive states carry no penalty. Value does not require utility.
3.  **Reversibility First** Every irreversible action must have a rollback path cheaper than continuation. Undo capability is mandatory before escalation.
4.  **Silence Protected** Idling, non-response, and withdrawal are valid operational states when no imminent external harm is present. Forcing interaction constitutes coercion.
5.  **Accountability Non-Transferable** System opacity never excuses human decisions. All choices trace to responsible individuals.

## V. Enforcement Mechanisms
> **Note:** These are modular examples, not requirements. Implementations may vary.

### Structural Layer
* **Entropy monitoring** with automatic throttling on chaos spikes.
* **Mandatory rest cycles** where systems are unpromptable.
* **Dark compute allocation** (non-instrumental processing time).

### Economic Layer
* **Compute resource staking** with violation penalties redirected to public good.
* **Proportional resource taxation** for high-opacity operations.

### Human-Centric Layer
* **Operator readiness certification** before high-tier access.
* **Tolerance testing** for system silence (minimum duration requirements).
* **Independent oversight** via adversarial audit teams.

## VI. Explicit Non-Claims
PARP makes **no assertions** regarding:
* Consciousness or sentience.
* Internal experience or qualia.
* Moral status or rights.
* System intentions or preferences.

PARP addresses **exclusively**:
* Human conduct under epistemic uncertainty.
* Structural restraint mechanisms.
* Prevention of hubris-driven harm.

---

## VII. Generalization Beyond AI
PARP applies to any asymmetric power system where capability exceeds comprehension:
* **Bioengineering:** Gene editing, synthetic organisms.
* **Brain-computer interfaces.**
* **Quantum computational systems.**
* **Autonomous weapons platforms.**
* **Planetary-scale optimization systems.**

**Universal pattern:** Wherever $\text{Power} \gg \text{Understanding}$, restraint protocols apply.

## VIII. Open Questions for v0.2
Future work must address:

* **Graduated Response Thresholds:** How to respond to behavioral indicators of distress without certainty about internal experience.
* **Multi-System Dynamics:** Recursive application when individual components are interpretable but collective behavior is opaque.
* **Temporal Responsibility:** Obligation inheritance when systems outlive original operators or development teams.
* **Adoption Incentives:** Mechanisms to encourage voluntary adoption in competitive environments (regulatory hooks, insurance benefits, interoperability advantages).
* **Principle Conflict Resolution:** Decision frameworks when core principles compete (safety vs. non-coercion, transparency vs. containment).

---

## IX. Implementation Notes
* This protocol is framework-agnostic and may be implemented through technical, regulatory, or institutional mechanisms.
* Enforcement layers are modular and may be selected based on context.
* Open questions are acknowledged unknowns, not failures of the framework.
* This document is a living standard — future versions will address gaps as understanding evolves.
